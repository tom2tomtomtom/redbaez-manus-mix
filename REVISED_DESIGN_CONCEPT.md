# Red Baez Revised Design Concept

## Design Direction
Based on user feedback, we've pivoted from the red neon aesthetic to a more cutting-edge, sophisticated design that feels modern and impressive. The new design concept focuses on creating a "wow" experience through:

1. **Ultra-modern minimalism** with sophisticated animations and transitions
2. **Cutting-edge 3D elements** that create depth and immersion
3. **Subtle color gradients** instead of the neon aesthetic
4. **Innovative scroll experiences** that reveal content in unexpected ways
5. **Avant-garde typography** that pushes boundaries while maintaining readability

## Color Palette
- Primary Background: Deep black (#0a0a0a)
- Secondary Background: Rich dark gray (#111111)
- Primary Accent: Electric blue (#3C91E6)
- Secondary Accent: Rich purple (#7B4AE2)
- Text: White (#ffffff) and light gray (#9e9e9e)

## Typography
- Headings: Monument Extended (bold, uppercase for major headings)
- Body: Inter (clean, modern sans-serif)
- Special elements: Gradient text effects for emphasis

## UI Elements
- **Glass-morphism**: Subtle transparency effects with backdrop filters
- **Gradient buttons**: Smooth transitions between accent colors
- **Hover animations**: Elements that respond to user interaction with subtle movements
- **Floating elements**: Content that appears to float above the background
- **Animated connections**: Visual elements that connect and animate to show relationships
